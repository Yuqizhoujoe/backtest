# Phase 5: Backtesting Engine (Week 6)

## Overview

Build comprehensive event-driven backtesting engine with realistic execution simulation, multi-timeframe support, and proper risk management integration.

## Objectives

- Implement event-driven backtesting architecture
- Create realistic execution simulation with slippage and commission modeling
- Build multi-strategy portfolio backtesting support
- Develop comprehensive risk management and margin calculations
- Integrate with existing strategy framework and pricing engine

## Key Components

### 1. Backtesting Engine (`src/backtesting/engine.py`)

```python
class BacktestingEngine:
    """Main orchestrator for backtesting operations"""
    
    def __init__(self, start_date: date, end_date: date, initial_capital: Decimal):
        self.start_date = start_date
        self.end_date = end_date
        self.portfolio = Portfolio(initial_capital)
        self.strategies: List[BaseStrategy] = []
        self.risk_manager = RiskManager()
        self.execution_engine = ExecutionEngine()
        
    def add_strategy(self, strategy: BaseStrategy) -> None:
        """Add strategy to backtest"""
        
    def run_backtest(self) -> BacktestResults:
        """Execute complete backtest simulation"""
        
    def process_market_day(self, current_date: date, market_data: Dict) -> None:
        """Process single trading day"""
```

### 2. Execution Engine (`src/backtesting/execution.py`)

```python
class ExecutionEngine:
    """Handles order execution simulation with realistic modeling"""
    
    def execute_order(self, order: Order, market_data: Dict) -> ExecutionResult:
        """Execute order with slippage and commission modeling"""
        
    def calculate_slippage(self, order: Order, liquidity_data: Dict) -> Decimal:
        """Calculate market impact and slippage"""
        
    def simulate_fill_probability(self, order: Order, market_data: Dict) -> float:
        """Estimate probability of order being filled"""
```

### 3. Risk Manager (`src/backtesting/risk_manager.py`)

```python
class RiskManager:
    """Portfolio risk management and margin calculations"""
    
    def check_margin_requirements(self, portfolio: Portfolio, 
                                 new_position: Position) -> bool:
        """Validate margin requirements for new position"""
        
    def calculate_portfolio_risk(self, portfolio: Portfolio) -> Dict:
        """Calculate comprehensive portfolio risk metrics"""
        
    def apply_risk_limits(self, signals: List[StrategySignal], 
                         portfolio: Portfolio) -> List[StrategySignal]:
        """Filter signals based on risk limits"""
```

### 4. Market Simulator (`src/backtesting/simulator.py`)

```python
class MarketSimulator:
    """Simulates market conditions and data flow"""
    
    def generate_market_events(self, date_range: Tuple[date, date]) -> Iterator[MarketEvent]:
        """Generate time-ordered market events"""
        
    def simulate_option_expiration(self, portfolio: Portfolio, 
                                  expiration_date: date) -> List[Transaction]:
        """Handle option expiration and assignment"""
        
    def apply_corporate_actions(self, portfolio: Portfolio, 
                               corporate_actions: List[Dict]) -> None:
        """Apply stock splits, dividends, etc."""
```

## Testing Requirements
